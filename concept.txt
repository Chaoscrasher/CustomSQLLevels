1 - simple loans 
It's a loan plugin, player would type something like 
/loan offer <user> <amount><time in days to repay><interest>
Then ever 24hours they user gets a payment auto taken from account if they can't afford to pay then they get a late fee
interest rate increases by 1% every late day.
every day that a payment cannot be fully processed due to low funds:
+1% interest
